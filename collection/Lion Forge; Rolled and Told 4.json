                "Now if you are new to playing the 5th edition of the world's most popular RPG, then this little tidbit of game mastery nonsense may not be for you. Though it should be! If you are a \"by the book\" kind of gamer, then this may not sound like anything you want in your game. Though you and your players are missing out. Now I can go on and on and tell every one of you that \"this may not be for you, but it really is\"… but I won't. Because if you don't use a bit of this rules-breaking mechanic in one of your play sessions, your game will be lesser for it. You need SPAWN MECHANICS in your life!",
                "I will not pretend to have invented spawn mechanics. That was done way back in 1985 by Atari Games when they brough us Gauntlet, in all its massive standing cabinet, hack-and-slashing, \"Red Warrior needs food badly!\", \"Green Elf is about to die!\" 8-bit glory. For crusty old gamers like myself who have been rolling funky shaped dice and scratching crazy Gygaxian dungeons on graph paper since I was ten in 1981, Gauntlet showed me (to my players' chagrin and joy) that tides of enemies rolling towards you cannot only be cool, heroic, and fear inducing, but a needed component of my game.",
                "If you need examples from folks far better than myself, you need to look no further than some of the movies that are so beloved by fans of our shared geeky ilk. The best example I can think of is Peter Jackson's version of Lord of the Rings. In Fellowship alone, Jackson gives us awesome examples of spawning monsters. He gives a tide of goblins along with their pet cave troll in the Mines of Moria scenes. We see our beloved heroes—backs to the wall, weapons at the ready—and a cave troll comes crashing into the tomb, a tide of rabid goblins in tow! If that doesn't blow your hair back, how about a mass horde of Uruk-hai orcs flooding through the hilly forest bellowing \"Find the Halfling!\" The battles are in-your-face furious, wild and glorious action. You can get the same effects at your game table with spawn mechanics.",

Because sometimes you have to think (or in this case play) out of the box. Being a Game Master isn't always easy.

We sacred few who take up our screens and produce game after game of goodness for our players need all the help we can get. We need a bag of tricks to keep things from getting boring.

The Big Nosh are led by a foul hearted ogress—Mama Yum-Yum—who got tired of living in caves. So she decided her ogres would just move into whatever settlement they raided, eat all the locals, livestock, and food stores, and then just head to the next settlement they find and do it again. That is the case with the small rural town of Springkernel. This back-country farming community, made up almost entirely of humans and halflings, is the third such town to face the Big Nosh. The ogres are thorough and have not yet left any soul able to give warning of their new pillaging methods. That is why no one in Springkernel ever saw the attack coming. There was no time to gather the militia and before anyone knew it, ogres were rampaging into the town market square, killing, capturing, or destroying everything in their wake. What the ogres don't know is that a group of adventurers spent the last night in town partying it up. So if they are not too hung over, the ogre tribe's plans might get thwarted."

They are all in some sort of drunken disarray when the massive ogre war band descends upon the town. This gives the PCs an additional challenge and makes for some inventive and entertaining encounters. The PCs being in multiple locations means the battles are more challenging for the GM as well, who will deal with running separate encounters as the PCs try to regroup and figure out what's going on. Switching back and forth between characters will be a good exercise for a new GM. Just make sure to give all the PCs equal time as best you can. Some of the PCs should end up in a combat no matter how you run the session. The combat should be hard for the PCs, btu doable, as the ogres are spread throughout the town in small groups when the game begins. Combats will get increasingly more challenging for the PCs as the ogres heard all the townsfolk they can find towards the central market—the site Mama Yum-Yum has chosen for her camp. She plans for the Town Hall in the central market to be the roasting building for her BBQ. By that time the PCs should have reunited or at least paired up. At least some of the PCs need to be together before you try to start the BBQ, because there are a lot of ogres to deal with in one place.",
