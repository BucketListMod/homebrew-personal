Through dark rites and foul rituals, they tried to birth a two-headed dragon to bend to their will and service. Little did the cult know, the dragon egg had a double yolk. Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves. Finding the orc tribe was just a bonus, in entertainment as well as serviceable minions."

The two white dragons and their orcs easily bested the six dwarves set as lookouts and took over the {@area Watchtower|D|x} that oversees the pass. The twin dragons have made the broken tower into a lair. Now the young dragons have shut down all trade, having attacked and stolen every wagon, mule, and traveler that has tried the pass. The dragons are never in the same place at the same time, except when in their lair. They have managed to conceal that there are two of them to all, save the dwarves that are captured and held at the {@area orc war camp|C|x}. This means that the PCs will have no clue that Gelidfrost is really two dragons, Gelid and Frost.",

The fifty miners are in bad shape. Until they've all had a good four days' rest with steady meals, they will be little or no help to the PCs in their efforts. Most all the miners have the equivalents of 4 levels of exhaustion (see core rulebooks for details). The prisoners at the {@area orc camp|C|x} (including Orewick's missing granddaughter Golda) are another story. The captive dwarves are badly beaten, but still in fighting shape if freed, fed, and armed.

Through dark rites and foul rituals, they tried to birth a two-headed dragon to bend to their will and service. Little did the cult know, the dragon egg had a double yolk. Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves.

If possible, keep flying to thwart melee combatants. Unless a PC declares an action to attack when something comes within melee range, such combat is made nearly useless. Even when declaring such an attack, a PC still gets only a single swing and not all their attacks. Use the dragon's breath weapon as often as you can. As soon as it refreshes, breathe again, as the damage of a breath weapon far exceeds any other damage the dragon can dish out. Do not spare any target from a dragon's wrath. If a target is unconscious or dying, eat them or stomp them. You are not picking on your players; you are roleplaying a dragon. Every dragon fight should be something a PC is never guaranteed to walk away from. Those that do walk away know they earned their lives and possibly a victory over a heinous foe. If the dragon becomes injured, have it use the {@action Dodge} and {@action Disengage} actions to your advantage, and save attacking enemies for Legendary Actions on their turns to make it harder for PCs and their allies to tie the dragon down to one place. A wizard may lay a {@spell fireball} or three {@spell scorching ray||scorching rays} on a dragon, but the next round that wizard is the main target of the dragon's wrath.

                    "This newly made alternative entrance was created by the twin dragons. The dragon-made cave is on the opposite side of the pinnacle as the winding stairs and is 100-feet up a sheer wall of ice-covered stone. Scaling such an obstacle during the raging blizzard requires climbing using Strength ({@skill Athletics}) {@dc 25} at disadvantage without a climber's kit. Creatures without a climb speed move as if in difficult terrain. The dragons dug the tunnel as an escape tunnel from their underground lair. Being fairly cunning and devious creatures, the twins have built in a few means of protecting both the cavern entrance and the tunnel it leads to. Firstly, the cavern and the tunnel are only 10 feet in circumference and barely large enough for the dragons to fit through. The cavern and many places in the tunnel leading to the lair are blocked with 6-inch-thick {@object ice wall|RolledTold5|walls of ice}. The dragons have layered 10 such walls (5-feet worth of thickness) every 15 feet of the tunnel, starting with the cavern and ending 150 feet later where the ice blockage is indicated on the Old Watchtower map. Additionally, the entire tunnel is slick with ice and is graded to form a deadly slide that forces any creature who falls {@condition prone} to start sliding towards the cave entrance at an increasing sliding speed. It begins at 20 feet slide speed and increases by +20 feet every round until the creature or object manages to stop themselves or is launched out of the high cavern entrance.",
                    "The dragons can easily smash through the walls without slowing and will use the slide for a quick exit if necessary. Any non-flying movement done on the ice slick tunnel counts as difficult terrain and requires a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) {@dc 10} at the beginning of each turn to even move at all without falling {@condition prone} and being subject to the ice slide. When doing something as complicated as combat, the Acrobatics check DC increases to {@dc 15}, made at the beginning of a turn before any action or movement is made (including trying to stand still or take the {@action Dodge} or {@action Help} actions). Once a character or object is sliding, that character or another within reach must use an action to succeed at a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) {@dc 20} to stop the slide. Using a piercing or slashing weapon slammed into the ice as an anchor can grant advantage on the {@skill Athletics} check to stop sliding. Then standing up from {@skill prone} will require the {@skill Acrobatics} {@dc 10} check, or they fall {@condition prone} again and start sliding once more.",
                    "If the PCs manage to overcome the deadly slide and numerous ice walls, then they come to the ice barricade—a 30-foot-thick version made up of 60 walls the same stats as the {@object ice wall|RolledTold5|ice walls} in the lower lair. If the PCs manage to break through that, then they will be in the cavern with the treasure hoard and a tunnel that leads to the rubble pile below the Watchtower (see the Old Watchtower map)."

A short set of stone steps leads to a fifteen-foot-wide arched doorway (the door is shattered and scattered about the rubble). Half of the three wooden-timbered floors have broken away. The sections of the floors that remain are sturdy enough to hold the weight of a dragon. The timbers that made up the missing sections of floor are piled, along with boulders and scree, 300 feet below in the excavated cavern lair that the twin dragons have constructed beneath the shell of the Watchtower. The missing section of the ground floor has been replaced with a horizontal {@object ice wall|RolledTold5}. The twins wall off the openness to safeguard the one who is asleep below. They easily shatter the ice to switch guard and slumber position, whereupon the dragon headed to bed remakes the ice wall using its breath weapon before retiring to sleep on the hoard. The ice floor section also serves as a trap. If engaged, the dragons try to lure non-flying foes out onto the ice and then one or both of the dragons break it, sending any standing on it to fall to their deaths 300 feet below, landing on jagged timbers and rubble.

Once either twin is attacked at the tower or below, the other will head to its sibling to aid in the battle, arriving {@dice ld4} rounds later. If the battle takes place in or around the Watchtower and is going badly for the dragons, the twins will retreat down into their treasure cavern as quickly as possible. The dragons will hurriedly consume as many of the healing potions as possible. One dragon will use a ready action to fight any foes that come down into the lair. The other dragon will use the exit tunnel and come around and attack the foes from the opposite side, essentially making the foes fight on two fronts."
