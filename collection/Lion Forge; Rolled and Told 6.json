A vicious creature slaughtered her father when she was so young she almost couldn't remember. But she had just been Crina then. Her title came after, and came with its own share of cruelties. It began when somehow, every morning, she was too weak to rise out of bed. The condition worsened. Soon she thought she would be free of the cruelty of living without a father's love as she lay bedridden and dying of what was deemed a plague. Another kind of plague took her younger brother, Dalibor, next. It snapped his neck like a twig and drank him dry, but only to have a chance at Crina. Had her brother not tried to defend her from the vampire, he would have been spared. But he did not want to give her up to a vampire as the rest of the village had. To the villagers, what was one sick girl, compared to dwelling in fear each night? But when Crina met him, Count Jarek Kilcos was not cruel, but gentle. He did not drink her dry and leave her blue-white corpse as a warning to the village. He did not snap her neck, as he had with her brother. No, the Count embraced her and gave her his gift in such a gentle kiss she barely felt the pain.",

She had begun her new life with him who had become both her second father, for he gave her this life, and her beloved husband. For the first time cruel fate, it seemed, had turned away from her. She had only been Countess Crina Kilcos for a short while when the village folk sent sellswords to slaughter her beloved Count and his servants. She only managed to survive the burning of the manor because of a gifted magic ring from the Count. She ran from the blazing manor and away from the village, vowing that one day the folk of Raven's Rest would bow down to the name of Kilcos once more. Though this time when they bow, it would be to a Countess, instead of a Count. And unlike them, she would not be cruel, but merciful. She would give them each a kiss, until all served her willingly in life, through blood-bound servitude or from the grave, but serve they shall…"

                    "The adventure takes place in an isolated village nestled in a forested valley in the foothills of a chain of mountains. The village has the only inn within several days' journey and is one of the last places to stop for basic supplies if crossing the mountains in this region, so it sees more than its fair share of visitors. Most visitors do not stay long, as the place and its folk seem to be perpetually sour and gloomy. There is little or no mirth, but most are extremely tight lipped about the reasons for the mood of all the village folk. Most of the action in the adventure takes place in the ruins of the old manor house, which has once again become the lair of a vampire and her minions, though roleplaying and investigation take place in the village. If the PCs are made aware of the vampire's control of the region and try to leave, packs upon packs of wolves will drive them back to the village, where they will either become servants of the vampire or be made examples of what happens to those that would leave and be slain. It may seem odd, since they were just trying to leave, but Countess Crina Kilcos was less than sane before she was made into a vampire and lost the only man she had ever thought she loved, so she could never let any adventurers that may know about her escape, lest they return and do to her what they did to her beloved Count Jarek.",
                    "Alternatively, if the PCs don't go about their investigations quietly while in the town, when night falls the Countess will sender her {@creature vampiric minion|RolledTold6|minion vampires} and a {@creature vampire spawn} to deal with them until the PCs try to leave and run into the waiting wolves, who heard them back to the village to be slain by her, or until they assault her lair. The PCs are safe from attack int he village during the daylight hours, though not in the wooded hills outside the village, where the wolves stalk (see {@adventure At The Mercy of Her Pack|LadyLasingKisses|3|At The Mercy of Her Pack} sidebar).",
                    "If you need tips on how to run the villagers of Raven's Rest, think of village folk as if they were in an enemy occupied town that was always being watched, Most or all the folk either fear the vampire and her minions and are just trying to avoid trouble and keep to themselves, or they are informants that will turn in whatever happens in the village to the Countess and her minions. Most of those not already loyal to the vampire don't know which other villagers are loyal or what animals are under her control. It is rumored that the Countess, \"The White Lady\" as she is called by some, can control the hearts of beasts and see through their eyes. All the village folk know is that they are trapped, and any villagers who have tried to leave in the past either had their children taken, were slain and risen as {@creature zombie||zombies}, or turned into {@creature vampire spawn} and forced to drink one of their loved ones as punishment. So it will take some digging and convincing for the PCs to fully uncover the truth and not make the vampire aware of their plans.",
                    "Most folk are curt, standoffish, or very sheepish if they have to interact with an outsider. The inn and any general services or trade are always fair, but far less than welcoming. The only reason anyone would stop here at all is because of its being the last place for supplies within several days' journey and the only inn for twice that distance—though, a warm, dry bed, a taste of ale, and a hot meal are not so enjoyable when provided only with the minimal of sour-faced grunts and interactions."

I have paper bags at home that do the job just fine, thank you. (I promise you that the dice don't care whether they're carried in plastic or vellum.) Whether you are in middle school or about to retire, there is no reason you can't play these amazing games. Your group's enjoyment of the game has nothing to do with how much you spend.",
                    "If you are trying to run a campaign for the first time, the shopping list is overwhelming. Some of us don't have that kind of disposable income, but it doesn't have to impact your gaming. You can be the Game Master of a fantastic campaign without spending a lot of money. It just requires prep, creativity, and a lot of stolen office supplies.",
                    "I first learned to play tabletop role-playing games with an outdated player's handbook that was missing the cover. I'm pretty sure one of my friends found it in a yard sale. We were all kids, so our resources were tied exclusively to birthdays and holidays. Every new expansion book required us to pool our money together, and we had to look for spare change just so we could photocopy character sheets. More often than not we went without rather than having a miniature that actually resembled our characters. The Wizard with the Missing Arm had to double as the Rogue, the Psionicist, the Owlbear, and even the Gelatinous Cube. We erased the names and stats on the character sheet over and over again until the entire paper was smudged gray on both sides. Somehow, we made it work. You can too.",
                    "Gaming manuals are a big investment in playing these games. Some groups have access to multiple rulebooks, but for most of my life players shared a single copy of these sacred texts. Thankfully, that is now less of an issue because: The Internet. Most modern game systems have the rules for character creation posted on their websites. In addition, game designers and players have made incredible resources to reference and search for specific rules. At my table I try to use the books as little as possible. I encourage players to design their own prestige classes or modify an existing power or feat to better suit their characters (within reason). I also challenge myself to come up with original monsters whenever possible. If there's a monster I want to include in an adventure but don't have access to their real stats, I make it up and nobody ever notices.",
                    "A resource that is surprisingly helpful for gaming manuals is the public library. More and more libraries are stocking their shelves with gaming lore and rulebooks. Libraries are also always always looking for suggestions on what titles to order. A few recommendations from you and your friends will go a long way, and save you, potentially, hundreds of dollars in books. Obviously, you can't keep the books forever (overdue library book fines are $$$), but at least you'll be able to photocopy selections of the most referenced pages of the rules.",
                    "Speaking of, a lot of players simply cannot host a game. Between families, roommates, and small apartments, having five or more friends over might be impossible. Hipper cities have options like game cafes, but those often require a cover to enter or a food/drink order minimum. Libraries and schools are an excellent option. Many libraries regularly host game nights, and if yours doesn't, it doesn't hurt to ask. Someone at your local library is in charge of events like story times or study room sessions or adult education classes. Talk to them.",
                    "Students also have other public spaces where they can game: namely classrooms. In my younger years, my friends and I routinely played in one of our chemistry teacher's rooms. Teachers work super hard and have to stay late every day. Take advantage of this by asking your favorite teacher to let you run some games there. The risk here is that if your teacher is cool enough to let you run RPGs in their classroom, they might want to join in.",
                    "Gaming materials are a huge expense of playing these games, but they shouldn't have to be. Maybe my most controversial gaming opinion is that miniatures, maps, and dice aren't worth the effort. I appreciate the beautiful sculpts, the time-intensive and detailed painting, and the power of a 1/60th scale fantasy realm.",
                    "Sadly, my apartment is too small to properly store a fantasy realm. I've resorted to using different-colored dice to differentiate characters. It's terribly clunky, yet effective. The best part of these games is Theater of the Mind, not exact recreations of every environment the game's characters will inhabit. Players have to use their imaginations and follow your lead as they inhabit these fantasy worlds. Simple drawings and describing the area in detail are all that's needed, really. For an effective, thrifty game master, less is always more. The newest miniature is only going to be impressive for so long. Players will remember the stories you all told together, rather than how cheap and boring your set-up was. Focus on gameplay over geography. You will be forgiven—even rewarded—for playing to your strengths. Your value as a Game Master is almost entirely contingent on your imagination and your friendships with the players.",
                    "That is why I rely on the most important weapon in a Game Master's arsenal: paper! There's nothing hundreds of dollars in miniatures and maps can do that a few scraps of paper can't. At the beginning of a campaign, make your players draw small drawings of their characters. (Then when they complain about not being able to draw, have them beg the most talented artist in your group to do it.) The uses for notecards and sticky notes alone are infinite. Make a lazy jigsaw puzzle to reveal an important clue or give players sticky notes to represent an important item. They will stick those little slips of paper onto their character sheet with pride. It's much more tactile and fun than simply adding another line of text to an equipment list.",
                    "You can make folded, simple paper standees that work just as well as pewter. It also helps Game Masters who prefer to improvise: There's no prep required. However, if you're going to draw every character and environment as your players encounter it, make sure you're quick about it. This builds into a hand-tailored style of running the game that helps players take ownership of your story. Campaign after campaign, adventure by adventure, I've been able to draw a full war-chest of settings, characters, monsters— even props. The best part is that they all fit in a single folder and aren't low-key embarrassing to carry around on the bus.",
                    "If your group prefers something more literal for its gaming tools, a sheet of cheap, clear vinyl over grid paper is excellent and very affordable. You can get that pretty cheaply from a craft store. It's very quick to set up a scene like this for your players, and it's easy to clean up. Just keep in mind that dry erase markers run out of ink fast if you're changing locations and maps often. There's also a lot to be said for raiding an old game closet or garage sale for makeshift gaming materials. A checkers board is perfectly functional as a grid square, and there are no shortages of d6s in the world. The other, more bizarre dice are a different story, however.",
                    "Fortunately, cell phones have made physical characters sheets and even dice obsolete in a lot of ways. While I prefer the sound of my tabletop getting cut up by dice, random number generators or free gaming-randomizer apps also work. And don't worry about players modifying the outcome of their rolls by using their tech savvy. Some players are going to fudge the numbers regardless of whether they are using a phone or actual dice. Just accept it. Digital character sheets are a good tool for newer players and very functional. I'm old-fashioned, so at my table I prefer paper because it's easier to keep track of a player's progress. Even though digital solutions may save you some money, be careful. You should try to keep your players' attention away from their devices as much as humanly possible. Once you lose that battle, you'll never get that turf back.",
                    "One of the greatest unplanned costs of hosting a game night is food. Even if your friends pool their money to pay for take-out, it gets pricey if you are running a regular weekly session. A group of six players can blow through a bag of chips in under a minute, so you often have to buy snacks in bulk. If your friends like to drink while they play (mine sure as hell do), it's even worse. Many of us were raised to be generous hosts, perhaps to a fault. There's no shame in asking the players to turn each session into a potluck! Or, if you're uncomfortable asking people to chip in, schedule the session after lunch or after dinner so that there's no expectation to raid your pantry.",
                    "All of this advice is just to let you know that, hey, money is in no way required to enjoy tabletop gaming. These things are designed to be flexible. Running an entire campaign might not fit in with your work schedule, and that's fine. The best, most innovative role-playing games are available for free online. And many of them are designed as one-offs. There are no rules as to how often you have to play. Yes, there are hardcore gamers who play multihour sessions every single day, but the rest of us have to work. Especially as you get older, a regular session might not be an option, given the time required. No matter how often you play, or with what kind of gaming supplies, maximize the fun.",
                    "Work within your own means. Your players will know if you're stressing out over something, and that ultimately hurts the game. This is a hobby like everything else, so don't go overboard in trying to mimic the lavish set-ups you see online. Their tables may be more elaborate, but in no way does that make them better. Your friends won't judge you for the elder ice dragon you made from paper-towel rolls and duct tape. In fact, they'll love you for it.",
                    "A savvy Game Master is efficient in using their time, their energy, and their finances. Then you can use all that saved cash and spend it on something truly worthwhile, like loot boxes for your favorite video game."

These rules mean we can make sense of the fantastic worlds by looking at what's different: mischievous fairies, magic swords, vast underground megastructures. But even these fantastic traits carry a sort of mechanical logic and familiarity. A {@spell fireball} spell may never exist in the real world, but your wizard always knows when they expend that 3rd-level spell slot, they get a 20-foot radius cyclone of fiery death.

Writing the bizarre means change, but with rules. Those rules can be obscure or counterintuitive, but you need at least some cursory guidelines. There needs to be some order, or reason, or internal logic, if only so the players know things are going badly when you break the rules later.",
                    "One of the best ways for showcasing the bizarre elements of your world is through contrast. One dot of color stands out brilliantly against a muted background, and likewise a lone strange element in an otherwise familiar situation—especially if no one else seems to notice it—seems far more unsettling and important than a firehose of random changes and oblique references. Likewise, adding some element of the mundane to a magical or supernatural element draws more attention to the rest of the strangeness. Maybe goblins in one adventure—a very familiar monster—have enormous secondary mouths in their stomachs, which speak an alien language and seem far smarter than the goblins themselves. Why? That's for you to figure out, but even if you never explain it, it adds an unsettling twist to something familiar to your players. In the other direction, taking your players to a psychedelic dimension of dreams might be fun, but adding an NPC who dresses and acts like a bored retail worker grounds the experience in something familiar, and makes both the dream world and the NPC seem weirder by the contrast. Consider what the rules are in your setting, follow them to their extremes, and then figure out a way to make your players interact with these unusual edge cases. Consider the {@spell fireball} spell: hold out a pinch of bat guano to create a ball of intense heat. Where does that heat come from? Does the spell open a momentary portal to an elemental plane? Could strange things try to slip out every time a {@spell fireball} spell is cast? What if there's a powerful, ancient fire elemental or genie that created the {@spell fireball} spell and gave it to humans as a means of escaping one tiny piece at a time? Or consider the bat guano—where does it go? And why guano? Is there a demiplane somewhere that collects the material components from spells as a sort of cosmic tax on magic? And if so, does that mean there are demiplanes filled with more valuable components, like the onyx from {@spell create undead} spells?",
                    "Consider whatever strange element you want to bring into your game and what rules apply to it. How do the PCs interact with it? What happens when they question it or try to learn more? What happens when they start rolling dice? Don't keep the bizarre completely out of their hands—if you do, your game becomes a lecture—but make sure they know that mastering this bizarre element isn't as easy or straightforward as they may think."

Like many story elements, bizarre elements feel more welcome and believable if you drop hints to your group early on. Use NPCs and world lore to spell out not only the rules of your world, but also to foreshadow the creepy times when those rules are broken. If you want an adventure in an Escher-esque world, start a few sessions earlier with a bard spinning campfire tale of a cursed artist who sought literal immortality through their works. If your players find the story interesting, you can feed them a bit more; perhaps the mayor's ancestors vanished mysteriously when they crossed a traveling artist.

                        "Popular imagery is full of ideas of what the afterlife is, amounting to a grand courtroom where the dead defend their lives. There's also the idea of gambling with death to return to life. If we combine these two ideas, we could see death as a casino, where every major deed in life translates to a chip that can be used in different games depending on the nature of the deed. The dead must win at least one game to move on, or slowly decay into dust, but if they can double their stake they can return to the living. In this scenario, a {@spell resurrection} spell wouldn't bring a dead adventurer back, but instead let the living join them in the casino and play on their behalf—the diamond spell component serving as their ante. This changes resurrecting a fallen friend into its own adventure, and depending on your players, that might be a high-stakes gambling story or a heist. "

What if fey and devils have their own otherworldly commodities market where they buy and sell memories like a modern-day stock market, with backroom deals, supply-and-demand, and speculation of which memories will be readily available in the future versus which are rare? Adventurers seeking one memory from the thousands traded every day may drive the price up, requiring them to run a con game to make the memory they need seem worthless. Or they'll have to strike a bizarre deal that requires them to forge very specific memories they agree to trade to a broker—if they can find one they trust. "

You may want to turn failed saving throws for these \"save or die\" effects into their own small encounters. The {@spell maze} spell tosses its target into an extradimensional maze for up to 10 minutes and requires an Intelligence test to escape—easy enough for a studied wizard, but frustrating for an action-hero fighter. If the maze is instead inside the spellcaster's mind, then the trapped fighter might run into different, hostile aspects of the wizard's psyche, either battling or roleplaying with them to distract the spellcaster or impose penalties back in the real world. In this scenario, the trapped player still contributes to the adventure, even if they can't win the day single-handedly, and the spell's challenge doesn't feel so hopeless! You can apply this idea to other effects where a failed save leaves a PC incapacitated for minutes or hours. Perhaps a medusa's petrifying gaze launches a character's soul into the Elemental Plane of Earth where they can try to beat elementals at riddle games. Or a sea hag's death glare traps a target's soul inside the raging storm of her own soul alongside however many souls she's claimed before. "

                    "Since 1977, many a player has faced the icy breath and gnashing jaws of the {@creature winter wolf}. This white, adventurer-eating critter has made (as far as I know) an appearance in every edition of the world's most popular RPG since its creation. In its current incarnation for 5th edition, this large-sized monstrosity comes in at a respectable Challenge 3 (700 XP). I mean, that's pretty realistic for 8 feet long, 4 feet at the shoulder, with an average of 75 hit points and the ability to breathe a 1 5-foot cone of 4d8 cold damage. Add in that it understands both Common and Giant, has Pack Tactics, and is kind of sneaky (Stealth +3, with advantage in snowy terrain), and your PCs have a rough foe to deal with. Think if it is not one, but a pack of 6-10 of these nasty critters coming at your favorite second tier (levels 5-10) party of adventurers—now that's a challenge.",
                    "Winter wolves are a super versatile monster that work great for first tier (levels 1-4) and even third tier (levels I I-1 6) play, as well. At low levels, a lone winter wolf can make for a nasty mini-boss fight or an even worse random encounter. At higher levels, the winter wolf becomes the servant, fodder, or ally monster for more powerful foes. Winter wolves serve the role of hunting hounds and guard dogs for frost giants. They make powerful minions for an evil wizard or sorceress. They also make great side quest encounters for single PCs of third tier levels.",
                    "If you need inspiration, look no further than the movie The Grey, starring Liam Neeson. Switch out the wolves for winter wolves and switch out the oil pipeline for a trade route and send the PCs hunting. You pretty much can mirror most of the scenes in the movie and have a nasty adventure (just change the plane crash to a wagon crash). So, watch the movie and consider it enjoyable GM homework for using wolves, worgs, and winter wolves on their own as foes for your PCs.",
                    "Let us get to tweaking for winter wolves. As I stated earlier, the 5e, Challenge 3 version is pretty good to go as is. But we can do some simple things to surprise your well-read or experienced players. The simplest is to add an Alpha wolf (or two, if you are feeling really nasty), if you are using a pack of winter wolves.",
                    "An Alpha is just a cut above the average winter wolf. To make something an Alpha on the fly, just give it max hit points instead of average, and give it +2 AC and +2 bonus on all d20 rolls. If you have time to throw a new stat block together, you just need a few stat bumps. First off, a bump up in natural armor (l mean, being the pack alpha is a tough job). Next, give your Alpha a Hit Dice and challenge increase. You can also add in a new ability, plus up the damage and recharge of the Alpha's attacks. If you do all that, you get the stat block below, as an example.",

If you are looking to use a lone winter wolf for, say, a random encounter for second tier PCs or as a solo monster for first tier PCs, then you might go with a winter wolf that is the lone survivor or has been shunned or outcast by their pack. Maybe the outcast lost a battle for pack leadership? In nature, when such occurs, most animals either die, join a new pack, or form their own new pack. The rare few that don't and still manage to eke out survival become quite fierce and savage. Such a winter wolf would make a great side quest for a second tier PC or party, or a whole adventure for a first tier party.",
                    "Think about this: What seems to be a pack of massive wolves has been slaughtering any travelers who dare to try and traverse the foothills and low trade trails of a mountain range during winter. The wolves only slaughter livestock and draft animals, but never eat them. They also leave no trace of any humanoids. The PCs are brought in to find and slay these menaces. Now the PCs get to try and figure this very un-wolf-like behavior out and track down what happened to the missing humanoids. When they track down the wolf den, they find the place carpeted with humanoid bones. They also discover there is only one very nasty, scarred, and feral winter wolf!",
                    "For this tweak we can just take the Alpha and make a few easy changes. Take away anything to do with a pack, give it some solo abilities, and if you are feeling frisky, make it a Legendary Monster with some Legendary and Lair actions. That is the easiest way to make a single foe feel like multiple foes, and most players hate it when a monster does actions on PCs' turns.",

                    "Now looking at this outcast, it is a very powerful combatant for Challenge 5, but this wolf is alone. This means all the PCs' attacks and abilities will be focused on it. The outcast does not have any great saving throws, and besides the cold breath, it is a melee fighter. Speed 50 ft.",
                    "So beating it only takes trapping it or keeping it at range. The Army of One ability makes that tough, but Mental-based spell saves will end the outcast. Also, all damage except Cold Damage works on it. One ranger with a long bow and one of the nastier ranged weapon feats will whittle away at the outcast's Hit Points in only a few rounds. If that ranger has at least three buddies, then the fight will be fun and interesting, but likely not go any way in the outcast's favor.",
                    "This is what you want when tweaking a monster. Make it a surprise to your players. Let the tweaks make the combat or encounter interesting. Last, but not least, make the monster beatable. In the end you want the PCs to win. You just want to rough them up and worry them while they do."
